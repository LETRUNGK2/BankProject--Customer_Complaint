This repository encompasses a project focused on analyzing consumer complaints related to financial products and services, as well as the responses provided by companies, spanning the years 2013 to 2015 in the United States.

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Gain insights into the various types of issues and sub-issues raised by consumers, along with their respective volumes.
Identify financial products and services that have received a high number of complaints.
Understand the volume of complaints associated with specific companies and assess their responsiveness in addressing these complaints in a timely manner.
Ultimately, the aim of this project is to provide valuable insights into financial issues and related products experienced by consumers, with the intention of offering recommendations to the relevant regulatory authorities. Additionally, this analysis can assist financial companies in better educating and empowering consumers about specific products and services before they make financial decisions, ultimately reducing the operational efforts required to resolve customer complaints.
